<code>R</code> is a powerful programming and statistical language. It is popular among scientists and, increasingly, journalists. The core program, known as "base R", does a variety of jobs well. But R's true power comes from a staggering number -- somewhere between 10,000 and 25,000 -- of tools or <code>packages</code> that seemingly can do everything short of baking a pizza. The most popular of these is a suite of packages for data manipulation and visualization developed by Hadley Wickham, known as the <code>tidyverse</code>.
