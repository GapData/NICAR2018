<code>R</code> is a powerful programming and statistical language. It is popular among scientists and, increasingly, journalists. The core program, known as "base R", does a variety of jobs well. But R's true power comes from a staggering number -- somewhere between 10,000 and 25,000 -- of tools or <code>packages</code> that seemingly can do everything short of baking a pizza. The most popular of these is a suite of packages for data manipulation and visualization developed by Hadley Wickham, known as the <code>tidyverse</code>. 

R owes much of its popularity to its price. As open-source software it is, by definition, free. So is the most widely used development environment for R, <code>R Studio</code>. So are the vast majority of R packages. The tradeoff is the learning curve. R is complex. You won't learn it in a few hours or days. Unless you have a superb memory or spend most of your time working with R, you will probably need to keep a manual nearby. It is not Excel. But Excel cannot do a tenth of what R can do.
