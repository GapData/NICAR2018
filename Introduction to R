<code>R</code> is a powerful programming and statistical language. It is popular among scientists and, increasingly, journalists. The core program, known as "base R", offers a variety of tools. But R's true power stems from the enormous number -- perhaps 10,000, perhaps as many as 25,000 -- add-on tools or <code>packages<code> that data scientists have created for it. The most popular are the suite of data manipulation and visualization tools invented by Hadley Wickham, known as the <code>tidyverse</code>.

Part of R's attraction is the price: It's open-source and therefore free. The development environment that most R users prefer, R Studio, is also free. So are the vast majority of R packages. The tradeoff is the learning curve.
